Parallel combination of a linear and a nonlinear load
Let the nonlinear load of fig. 12.1 be removed.
Then, in fig 12.2
i_l = 0 (12.17)
i = i_b = e_in / (Z_a + Z_d) (12.18)

The subscript '1' is now used indicate the 
impedance to the fundamental or supply frequency harmonic of current.
Let the combined input impedance be Z_a1d1,where
Za1d1 = Za1 + Zd1 = |Za1d1| < phai_a1d1 (12.19)
Note that
|Za1d1| = \sqrt{|Za1|^2 + |Zd1|^2 + 2|Za1||Zd1|cos(phai_a1 - phai_d1) } (12.20)
phai_a1d1 = tan^-1 () (12.21)

Let the capacitor Zc,fig 12.2 now be removed.
With this condition
Z_d1 = Z_b1 (12.22)
Combinig (12.8) to (12.22)

(12.23)

For the condition to linear, uncompensated load Z_b the load voltage e_0 is modified to 
(12.24)
Combining (12.33) and (12.24) gives
(12.25)
Current i at the load can be resolved into hypothentical components i_R,i_x(with respect to e_0) that would flow if an equivalent parallel load of pure resistance and pure reactance was used.
(12.26)
(12.27)
Combining the rms forms of (12.26) and (12.27) with the rms form of (12.25) gives components of the apparent voltamperes at the load terminals.
(12.28)
(12.29)
For unity power factor operation at the load the capacitor C,
fig 12.2,must compensate i_x of (12.27) and must thereby have a voltampere rating equal to S_x of (12.29) therefore
(12.30)
(12.31)
The impedance Z_d1,looking into the terminals of the compensated load is given by 
(12.32)
For a completely compensated load the input impedance,(12.32),is purely resistive.
