Many practical circuits,including electric transmission and distribution networks may be represented in the form of a series R-L load.
An ideal single-phase,sinusoidal voltage source of constant frequency supplies a series load of resistance R and inductance L in fig3.1.
Any resistance due to the inductor winding is presumed to be included in resistor.
The instantaneous voltage e and current i are given by A.

Kirchhoff's loop law the instantaneous load voltage is the sum of the component voltage ER,EL across the separate load components R,L,respectively.

The instantaneous power EI entering the circuit of fig3.1 is given by combing (3.1),and (3.2)

The two forms of (3.8) are found to be true for the instantaneous terminal power of any two-terminal R-L circuit regardless of the topology of the circuit elements.
In(3.8) the rms or effective voltage E is given by (3.9)

Effective Voltage E and effective current I are the values that would be read on properly connected moving-iron instruments of suitable frequency response.

In calculations on liner circuits with sinusoidal supply,voltage E is often represented in phasor form and circuit calculations made by reference to phasor diagrams.

The method of phasor diagram representation must be limited to sinusoidal systems of fixed frequency and so,although relevant in this chapter,would not apply to subsequent work in this book

Accordingly,physical consideration of time variation proceeds throughout by the use of diagrams denoting instantaneous time variation
