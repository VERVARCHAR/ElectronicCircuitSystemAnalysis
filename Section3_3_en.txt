A more general two-terminal passive circuit is now discussed to demonstrate typical properties associated with power distribution and energy interchange between reactive components. 

The particular form of RLC network chosen,fig 3.5,has a series R-L branch shunted by a series R-C branch.

This form of circuit is of particular interest because,as reported by Hallen,
the instantaneous rate of energy dissipation in resistor R1,R2 can be made time invariant.

The circuit equations for fig3.5,with an ideal sinusoidal voltage supply,are given by A
